# üéôÔ∏è Voice Gender Classification Using AI and Signal Processing

This project uses **real human voice audio recordings** to classify gender (Male/Female) using **feature extraction techniques** and a **Random Forest machine learning model**. Built with Python, it demonstrates the practical application of signal processing in intelligent voice systems.

## üì¶ Dataset

- **Name**: [Gender Recognition by Voice (Original)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murtadhanajim/gender-recognition-by-voiceoriginal)
- **Format**: `.wav` audio files

## üß† Model Overview

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features Extracted**:
- MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
- Chroma Frequencies
- Spectral Centroid
- Zero Crossing Rate

## üß™ Model Performance

| Metric        | Female      | Male        |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Precision     | **0.99**    | **0.99**    |
| Recall        | **0.98**    | **0.99**    |
| F1-Score      | **0.98**    | **0.99**    |
| Overall Accuracy | **99%** |

‚úÖ Confusion matrix and classification report are printed during training.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. Download `.wav` dataset from Kaggle using `kagglehub`
2. Extract features from each audio file using `librosa`
3. Train a `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn`
4. Save the model to disk
5. Predict gender from new `.wav` voice samples

### **NOTE:** Work is ongoing to improve the predictions because the model is slightly overfitted.
